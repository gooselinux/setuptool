.SH NAME
setup \- A text mode system configuration tool
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBsetup\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
The setuptool program (\fBsetup\fP) is a front-end menu program for a group of other
tools, mostly \fBsystem\-config\-*\-tui\fP tools. The list of options which it presents is assembled by scanning
/etc/setuptool.d and /usr/share/setuptool/setuptool.d for files.

Each file in the directory should contain one or more lines of text.  Each line
contains from one to four fields which are separated by "|" characters.  In
order, they are:
  - the path to the binary to invoke (mandatory)
  - the untranslated name of the application which should be displayed
    (If unset, defaults to the path of the binary, but don't depend on that.)
  - the gettext textdomain in which a translation of the name of the application can be found
    (If unset, defaults to "setup".)
  - the directory in which translations for the textdomain can be found
    (If unset, defaults to "/usr/share/locale".)

If multiple entries with the same untranslated name exist, the one which was
read FIRST takes precedence. Files are read in name collation order.
.SH EXAMPLE
A contrived example would create /etc/setuptool.d/00bogus with these contents:

.nf
  /bin/ls --color; /bin/sleep 5|Example "ls" invocation.
.fi

or

.nf
  /bin/ls --color; /bin/sleep 5|Give this help list|libc
.fi

to use one of libc's (not meaningful here, but) translatable messages.
